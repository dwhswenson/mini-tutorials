# OpenPathSampling Mini-Tutorials

This repository contains small tutorials that cover specific topics. If you're
just getting started with OpenPathSampling, you'll probably be more interested
in [the introductory OPS
tutorial](http://github.com/openpathsampling/ops_tutorial).

The tutorials here have either been used in short workshops or have been the
subject of screencasts on the OPS YouTube channel.
